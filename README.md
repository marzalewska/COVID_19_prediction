# COVID_19_prediction

This project covered the topic of analysing and predicting the number of illnesses and number of deaths due to COVID-19 using global data from the COVID-19 Data Hub. 

Project implementation steps:
- Initial data analysis: Data mining to understand variables and country selection for local analysis based on data quality.
- Feature Engineering and Data Cleaning: Identification and removal of redundant variables, handling missing data by completing or eliminating observations.
- Regression modelling: Running linear and multivariate regressions, analysis of residual distributions and collinearity of variables.
- Testing of advanced algorithms: Implementation and comparison of the results of SVR, regression trees and random forests without hyperparameter tuning.
